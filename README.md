# Image Recognition with LLaVa ðŸŒ‹

This repository contains an image recognition project using Python.

## How the Project Works
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and neural networks to recognize and classify images. It includes training scripts to build models from image datasets and evaluation scripts to assess the performance of these models.

### Key Components
- **Training**: The `train.py` script trains a neural network on a dataset of labeled images. The training process involves multiple epochs, where the model learns to identify patterns and features in the images.
- **Evaluation**: The `evaluate.py` script evaluates the trained model's accuracy and performance using a separate validation dataset.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained models can be used for inference without the need to train from scratch, saving time and computational resources.

## Features
- Training scripts for image recognition models
- Evaluation scripts for model performance
- Pre-trained models and datasets
